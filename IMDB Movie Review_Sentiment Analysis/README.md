This is a sentiment analysis project of Natural Language Processing. In this project, firstly a three-layer shallow model was built, where the first layer was one embedding layer to convert words to a 100-length vector, the middle dense layer was for output shape and the last one was the final output layer. After implementing this shallow model to improve the model performance, gated recurrence relation was implemented. A single unidirectional & bidirectional LSTM layer was implemented. After implementing these two LSTM layers it is confirmed that both of their performance were better than the previous shallow model. However, the best result was provided by the bidirectional LSTM layer.
