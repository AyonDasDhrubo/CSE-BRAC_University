This Project was included in my lab work of Artificial Intelligence course. 
This is a Spam Email prediction project which is focused to predict an Email is Spam or not. 
In this project TfidfVectorizer & Bag of words is used for Feature Extraction. 
Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier & Support Vector Classifier model is used for analyzing performance on different models.
Lastly, all the used model performance is compared with the use of two Feature Extraction methods.
