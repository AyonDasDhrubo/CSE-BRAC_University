These are the Lab Assignment files with solution of Brac University's Computer Science & Engineering departmental core course CSE420 known as Compiler Design of Summer '2023. The main focus of this lab was to introduce how a compiler works in it's differnet compilation steps. 
The first lab was to introduce to the basics steps of a compiler Design and more specifically focused on how compiler works in Lexical analysis phase.
In the second lab, the lab task was to construct a lexical analyzer where we construct a scanner for a subset of Python language using a tool named flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) which is a popular tool for generating scanners.
In the third lab, we focus to construct the last part of the front end of a compiler which is syntax analysis for a subset of the C language  with a grammar rule containing
function implementation with the help of Lex (Flex) and Yacc (Bison).
In the forth lab, the task was to write code to parse a fixed set of CFG using LL(1) parsing table using any built in libraries.
